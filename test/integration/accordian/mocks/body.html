        <div><strong>What’s the difference between the DOC and DOCX file format?</strong></div>
        </div>
        <div>
        <div>The DOC and DOCX file formats are file extensions used by Microsoft Word. The DOC file format is an older format used by Microsoft Word 2003 and earlier. With the release of Microsoft Word 2007, Microsoft introduced the new DOCX file format based on the Open XML (Extensible Markup Language) standard. If you have Microsoft Word 2003 or earlier, you’ll need to download the free Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack to open, edit, and save DOCX files.</div>
